## Building

You will need:
- The GTK 4 development library
- Rust compiler and Cargo
- Meson and ninja-build
- Gettext (for translations)

You will also need to build and install so the gresource and schemas files can be found during runtime.
```
meson build
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build install
sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/local/share/glib-2.0/ (or whatever your schemadir is)
```
